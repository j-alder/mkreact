# mkreact
CLI for installing and configuring a minimal, ready-to-dev React front-end. The goal of this project 
is to provide an alternative to create-react-app by limiting abstraction and maximizing customizability 
(think vue-cli or jHipster).

### Development roadmap
- [ ] cli args
- [ ] webpack configuration
- [ ] git initialization
- [ ] rollup option and configuration
- [ ] typescript support
